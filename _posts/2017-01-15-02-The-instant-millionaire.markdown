A Fable about how to get rich and wealthy (also in a non-materialistic sense). A young man is not happy with his life and his job. He visits his rich uncle for advice and money. His uncle refers him to the „Instant millionaire“, who helped him when he started. The Instant millionaire will reveal his secrets to him…

The book is a mediocre story about key factors to become rich, like setting goals, believing in them and repeating them and inspection of yourself to know your real desires and aims. The story itself is not very exciting, but for a reader who wants to become wealthier in life it contains a few tricks and hints.
